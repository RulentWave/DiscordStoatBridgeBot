# Discord ↔ Stoat Bridge

A lightweight bidirectional bridge that forwards messages between Discord and Stoat channels using webhooks and masquerade.

## How it works

```
Discord user → Discord Bot → Stoat channel  (via Stoat masquerade)
Stoat user   → Stoat Bot   → Discord channel (via Discord webhook)
```

Messages are forwarded in real time. Usernames and avatars are carried over so it looks native on both platforms.

### Replies

| Direction | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Discord → Stoat | Native reply when the original message is in cache; sent without reply otherwise |
| Stoat → Discord | Quote fallback (`-# ↩ **Author**: *snippet*`) – Discord webhooks do not support native replies |

The bridge caches the last **500** message ID pairs in memory (you can change this value). Replies to messages older than that are sent without a reply indicator.

### Files & attachments

| Direction | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Discord → Stoat | The bare attachment URL is appended to the message text |
| Stoat → Discord | File is downloaded into RAM and re-uploaded as a Discord attachment. Files larger than **25 MiB** are sent as a fallback link instead |

### Mention & emoji resolution

| Direction | What gets resolved |
|---|---|
| Discord → Stoat | `<@id>` → `@Nickname`, `<#id>` → `#channel-name`, `<@&id>` → `@role-name`, `<:n:id>` → `:n:` |
| Stoat → Discord | `<@ULID>` → `@DisplayName`, `:ULID:` → `:emoji-name:` |


## Setup

### Local Setup

#### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A Discord bot with the **Message Content**, **Server Members**, **Guilds**, and **Webhooks** intents enabled
- A Stoat bot

#### Install Steps

```
pip install discord.py stoat.py aiohttp python-dotenv
```

**1. Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/discord-stoat-bridge.git
cd discord-stoat-bridge
```

**2. Create your `.env` file**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then fill in the values:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) |
| `STOAT_BOT_TOKEN` | Token from your Stoat bot settings |
| `DISCORD_CHANNEL_IDS` | Comma-separated Discord channel IDs to bridge |
| `STOAT_CHANNEL_IDS` | Comma-separated Stoat channel IDs to bridge |
| `REVOLT_API_URL` | *(optional)* Revolt API base URL. Defaults to `https://api.revolt.chat` |

> **Pairing:** position 1 of `DISCORD_CHANNEL_IDS` is bridged with position 1 of `STOAT_CHANNEL_IDS`, position 2 with position 2, and so on. The two lists must have the same length.

**3. Discord bot permissions**

Make sure your bot has the following permissions in the target channel:

- Read Messages
- Send Messages
- Manage Webhooks

**4. Run**

```bash
python bridge.py
```

### Docker Run

Alternatively, you can run the bridge via Docker. Just create your .env file from the local setup steps, then run the following command

```bash
docker run \
  --env-file .env \
  ghcr.io/jmgstudios/discordstoatbridgebot:latest
```
```
```

## Notes

- The bridge creates a webhook named `Stoat Bridge` in your Discord channel automatically. If one already exists from a previous run it will be reused.
- Messages originating from the bridge webhook are ignored to prevent forwarding loops.
- Stoat custom emoji names are resolved via the Stoat API and cached in memory for the duration of the process.
